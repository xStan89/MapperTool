Gwyn Morgan,"Gwyn Morgan is the founding CEO of EnCana Corp., Canada’s largest energy company. He stepped down as CEO in 2005.3 Morgan joined SNC-Lavalin as chairman in 2007 and stepped down in May 2013 following a “wake of high-profile bribery scandals surrounding the company.”

EnCana was the result of a merger between PanCanadian Energy Corporation and the Alberta Energy Company (AEC). AEC was created in 1973 “to initiate a capital investment program and lessen dependence on foreign oil.” The Government of Alberta initially owned half of AEC, making it what some described as “the only certain winning investor in the multi-billion-dollar Syncurde project.”

Morgan first joined AEC within months of its early operations, developing the Suffield-block gas resources, and became its CEO in 1993 after David Mitchell stepped down.” Morgan stayed on as head of Encana, which became the world’s largest independent oil and gas producer at the time after the merger. 

Gwyn Morgan and his wife, Patricia Trottier, founded the Gwyn Morgan and Patricia Trottier Foundation in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

According to his profile at The Globe and Mail, where he is a contributing writer, Gwynn Morgan is a trustee of the Fraser Institute, the Manning Centre for Building Democracy, now the Canada Strong and Free Network, and the Dalai Lama Center for Peace and Education. He has reportedly donated nearly $200,000 to the BC Liberals from 2011 to 2017.

He has served on the boards of various companies and nonprofit organizations, including American Petroleum Institute (API), the Accenture Energy Advisory Board of Accenture Ltd., the Canadian Council of Chief Executives, the Institute of the Americas, and the board of governors of the Canadian Unity Council, among others.11",,"1,2,3,8,11","1,2,3,8,11",,,https://i.ibb.co/LzbppFw9/Gwyn.png,,https://www.desmog.com/gwyn-morgan/,TRUE,TRUE,714,435.2,
